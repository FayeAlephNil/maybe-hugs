# maybe-hugs

Sometimes, you want to offer someone a hug. Maybe they're cute and you like
them. Maybe they feel bad and you want to comfort them. Some humans like
physical contact. Some don't. Some like them from you, and some might prefer
them from someone else. Maybe they just don't feel like being touched right now
even though they usually love hugs.

So this repo is for writing code that shows others how to be empathic but
respectful and consent-oriented. It's supposed to make the world a cuter,
gentler place.

I look forward to seeing what you come up with. MaybeHugs provided to all
contributors.

Just make a PR with your own interpretation of a solution! Be as creative or funny or poignant as you want.

If the language you want to write already exists, why not make another folder
with the same language? Just suffix it with `-something` and it'll be gladly
accepted. :)
